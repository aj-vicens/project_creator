# A simple way to organize reporting files

Back in 2019 [Andrew Donohue](https://www.revealnews.org/author/andrew-d-donohue/), then the Managing Editor of Reveal at the Center for Investigative Reporting, posted a question to Twitter that I've often wrestled with:

His question spurred a great conversation, but the answer posted by [Tyler Dukes](https://www.wral.com/rs/bio/13311372/), an investigative reporter at WRAL in North Carolina, caught my eye:

I spend a fair amount of time in my command line and liked the idea of being able to type in a command, give it a name, and have a uniform approach to organizing materials for my stories. I asked him to share with me his script, which he did. Based on and inspired by his script, I created my own for the Mac environment. My bash script is functional but I'm sure it's redundant. I'll work to streamline it but for now it works.

As with any script, you're going to need to make it [executable](https://askubuntu.com/questions/229589/how-to-make-a-file-e-g-a-sh-script-executable-so-it-can-be-run-from-a-termi) and make sure it's on your [PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14650070/how-to-execute-bash-script-from-any-location). 

Thank you Andrew and Tyler (and everybody else in [that thread](https://twitter.com/add/status/1122939226931089408?s=11)) for sharing the knowledge and helping us all stay a bit more organized..
